== Description ==

<a href="https://responsive-gallery-grid.bdwm.be/shortcode-generator/">Shortcode generator</a>

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in Wordpress Admin
1. That's it! Your default WordPress Galleries should now all look titled and responsive!

= Finetuning =

If you want to finetune the options per gallery you can add some parameters to the gallery shortcode (from text editor).

Documentation available at https://responsive-gallery-grid.bdwm.be/shortcode-parameters/

You Can also change the default options for all galleries under Settings > RGG Gallery

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add a lightbox to the gallery? =

Since version 2.2.1 the plugin includes a copy of SimpleLightbox. A lightweight responsive lightbox, which you can activate from the RGG Gallery page in your wordpress dashboard.
If you don't like the lightbox, or you think it's too lightweight, you can keep it disabled and install a third party lightbox plugin. Most lightboxes that work with the native WP gallery will work.

= The images to the left and right of the grid are cut of when I mouse over them. How do I solve this? =

This will happen if one of the grid containers have the CSS property <code>overflow:hidden</code>. If possible, you will
need to change this to <code>overflow:visible</code>. If not, you can
wrap the gallery inside a div, and assign some margins to it. If that's no option either, you should just disable scaling, or use negative scaling
by setting the <code>scale</code> property to a value between 0.5 and 1 in the schortcode.

= How can I further configure and modify the gallery to my needs? =

Need anything else? Please start a support thread?

= Will there be added more options? =

Sure. Please start a support thread for any of your requests.

== Upgrade Notice ==

1. RGG now uses native gallery features to retrieve the images, this means you can no longer add multiple instances of the same image to a single gallery. If you need this feature, please revert to version 1.3.

== Screenshots ==

1. Responsive Gallery Grid in action. By default the images will pop out on mouse-over.
2. The gallery shortcode can be extended with some options, from the text editor.
3. From the WYSIWYG view the gallery looks like an ordinary Wordpress gallery, so you can easily add and remove pictures the way you are used to.
4. You can pimp eacht individual gallery to your needs by updating the gallery shortcode paramaters. (Check out the documentation)

* Fix PHP Warning: Attempt to read property "ID" on null

= 2.3.7 (2022-12-23) =
* Fix bug: Remove href attribute when link="none". Thanks for [reporting](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/link-to-feature-doesnt-work/) @cahajla
* Worked a bit on the development environment. Preparing to release some more updates in the near future.

= 2.3.6 (Dec 10, 2020) =
* Disabled Swipebox because it's not compatible with jQuery 3.5.1 included with WP 5.6. Swipebox now automatically falls back to SimpleLightbox. (Thanks to Christopher Jones for the detailed report)
* Include slick library in project instead of loading it from CDN

= 2.3.5 (Sep 25, 2020) =
* Make even more compatible with Real Media Gallery plugin (thanks to the guys who make RML)

= 2.3.4 (Apr 9, 2020) =
* Remove print_r statement

= 2.3.3 (Apr 29, 2020) =
* Make compatibel with Real Media Library plugin (https://bit.ly/3d9QSUb) - Big thanks to @mguenter for the patch and @bit024 for reporting
* Add the image alt text as aria-label (can't use alt attribute because the images are CSS background-images)

= 2.3.2 (Apr 11, 2020) =
* Tested with WP 5.4 (no other changes)

= 2.3.1 (Apr 19, 2019) =
* Fixed small bug after resizing window + some code re-organization.

= 2.3 (Apr 19, 2019) =
* Added alternative to lightbox: Show image above gallery. This will create a synchronized slider above the gallery. On clicking an image in the gallery, the corresponding image becomes the active slide.

= 2.2.2 (Apr 16, 2019) =
* added additional lightbox: simplelightbox (https://simplelightbox.com/). I recommend using simplelightbox as swipebox seems to be no longer maintained by its developer.

= 2.2.1 (Jun 7, 2018) =
* Fixed bug that was breaking gallery after update 2.2

= 2.2 (Jun 6, 2018) =
* Added Swipebox as a built-in lighthbox. Plugin still works fine with Responsve Lightbox. But Responsve Lightbox is getting a bit heavy and recently added it's own gallery solution, which looks confusing if you want to use it together with RGG. So I decided to include a lightweight lightbox.

= 2.1.2 (Jan 28, 2018) =
